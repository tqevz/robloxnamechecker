There is a password on the WinRAR file: gazauk on Discord | ya heard.

This is a remake of an old name checker from five years ago. I updated the API to make it much faster.

All 2-letter and 3-letter usernames are already taken, so don't bother trying.
Most 4-letter usernames are taken as well.

There is also a username generator included.

All of this was made in Python.
